It is a morning raga and singing this must represent a devotional atmosphere with some element of pathos included. Many people incorrectly relate the scale of this raga to Egyptian or Mid-Eastern melodies. Those melodies lack many of the important vakra, or zig-zag features, of the raga.

Bhairavi is considered the freest raga, as there are many ways to go about performing this raga. Artists even will include vivadis, or grace notes, to sweeten the flavor. The most common grace notes are the usage of Re and Dha. Bengali artists use Ga, especially in the Baul bhajans. Ma and Ni are used less frequently, but are found here and there. Another factor that adds to its freedom status is that even though it is recommended for the morning, it is really sung at any time. Usually, after a long performance, this raga is almost always used as a grand-finale raga. Majority of classical based numbers are in Bhairavi. Even popular and folk music employ Bhairavi in unique ways. Most of them tend to use “ma” as the strong vadi and the samvadi being “Sa.”"

Kausikdhwani is the Carnatic name of the raga, so it may have emanated from the South Indian musical system. Another theory suggests that it came from Raga Pancama. The hidden truth about this raga, which is one of the many reasons why it’s beautiful, is that it hides few ragas in here. When doing melodic fills, known as tans, some will be reminded of the joys of Bhairavi, the hurt in Jogiya/Gunakri, the pining feel or Yaman Kalyan, or separation through Sivaranjani. For the additional feel, artists will use a chromatic approach by using komal and shuddha dha simultaneously."

In Raga Bihaga, D was used in a glance. In addition, the M and m usage was allowed a chromatic feel. The m swar had not much of an impact in the whole scope of the raga, but it was needed. In Maru-Bihaga, D has a little more importance. Even though it is not used as often as the purvanga, it has a full value, instead of a glimpse-value. In addition, m has its own sustain when used in the avaroha. It is not used in a chromatic sense or even attempt to try to reproduce a chromatic feel as Raga Bihaga does. It is a very lovely raga depicting devotion and love."

The first unique feature of this raga is that there is no Pa or suddha Ma. These two notes imply stability with the Sa. The most likely reason why Pa and suddha ma do not take place is because, Sa, in this raga, is avoided a lot. It will be confusing for one to listen to this raga, as the tonic seems to disappear. Thus, the mood of this raga can be said to describe anxiety or melancholy, as there is no stability. There is no harmonic stability, as the komal re and dha form the vadi-samvadi pair. Since komal re is the vadi (the strongest note), the komal re in this particular raga creates an otherworldly ghastly feel. Hence, another mood of this raga is fear. Lastly, this raga is the supposed representative raga of the Marwa that. Marwa that has a Pa in it, however, Marwa’s behavior and scale is absolutely different. Usually, almost all representative ragas will share the same notes as its that."

Even though Sa and Pa are the strongest harmonic pair in this raga, another noteworthy pair is to consider is that of Ga and Ni. Whenever Ga is played, the shadow of Ni comes. This actually comes from Raga Puriya, which makes up the component of this raga. In Raga Puriya, Ga and Ni are the vadi-samvadi pair.

Therefore, Purvi was used, which had the flow just like Puriya Dhanasri, except with one exception, there was a shuddha ma used sparingly. The suddha ma produces a haunting harmony with Sa, as the other strongest harmonic pair is Ga with Ni. The raga should be sung in the first part of the prahar in conjunction with Raga Sri."
