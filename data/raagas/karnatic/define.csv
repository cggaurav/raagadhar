Vadi;Vadi, in both Hindustani classical music and Carnatic music, is the dominant swara (musical note) of a given raga (musical scale). "Vadi is the most sonant or most important note of a Raga."" It does not refer to the most played note but it rather refers to a note of special significance. It is usually the swara which is repeated the greatest number of times, and often it is the swara on which the singer can pause for a significant time. Vadi swara in a raga is like a king in a kingdom. Specialty of any raga is depend on vadi swara and because of this vadi swara is also called as Jeeva swara or Ansha swara. A good artist uses vadi swara in different ways like singing vadi swara again and again, starting a raga with vadi swara, to end a raga with vadi swara, singing vadi swara many times in important places with different-different swaras or sometime singing vadi swara for longer time in one breath.Vadi swara is also helpful to identify the time of singing or playing a raga. If vadi swara of a raga is from purvanga part of saptak i.e. “Sa Re Ga Ma”, then it is called as purvanga vadi raga and usually time for singing or playing purvanga vadi ragas are from 12 pm to 12 am for example ragas like Bhimpalasi, Pilu, Purvi, Marwa, Yaman, Bhoopal, and Bageshree etc. have purvanga vadi swara and so the time for singing and playing these ragas is between 12 pm to 12 am. In the same way if vadi swara of a raga is from utranga part of spatak i.e. “Pa Dha Ni” then it is called as utranga vadi raga and time for singing or playing utranga vadi ragas is from 12 am to 12 pm. For example ragas like Bhairav, Bhairavi, Bilawal, Kalingada, Sohini, and Asavari etc. have utranga vadi swara and so the time for singing or playing these raagas is between 12 am to 12 pm.;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadi_(music)
Samvadi;In Indian classical music, the second-most prominent note of a raga is referred as samvadi. This could be misleading, as it may not necessarily refer to the second-most played note. Samvadi is a subsonant note.If vadi is like a king, samvadi is like minister for a raga. In most cases the Vadi and Samvadi notes are a fourth or fifth apart. For example, Shadja and Suddha Madhyama, Suddha Rishabha and Suddha Dhaivata, Suddha Gandhara and Suddha Nishadha, Sadaharana Gandhara and Kaisiki Nishada, Antara Gandhara and Kakali Nishada, Suddha Rishaba and Prati Madhyama are samvadi swaras. A samvadi is a note of special significance. A performer will typically try to emphasize the samvadi along with the vadi when improvising on a certain raga. The vadi and samvadi can be crucial in defining the raga at hand, and in some cases two ragas with the same arohana and avrohana can be distinguished only by the prominence of their sonant and consonant notes.;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samavadi
Aroha;Arohana, Arohanam or Arohan, in the context of North Indian Classical Music and South Indian Classical Music, is the ascending scale of notes in a raga[1]. The pitch increases as we go up from Shadjam (Sa) to the Upper Stayi Shadjam (Sa).;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arohana
Avaroha;An Avarohana, Avarohanam or Avarohan in Indian classical music terminology is the descending scale of any raga. Each raga has an avarohana and arohana. The notes descend in pitch from the octave tonic (Shadjam or Sa) down to the lower tonic. The Avarohana encompasses the notes included in descending passages but may also specify ornaments such as meend or gamak, convolutions in the scale (where it may not be a simple descending line) etc. Not every raga follows notes down in a strictly decreasing pitch.;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avarohana
That;A thāt is a mode in northern Indian or Hindustani music. Thāts always have seven different pitches (called swara) and are a basis for the organization and classification of ragas in North Indian classical music.;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_(music)
Prahar;In Indian languages, prahar is a unit of time. A day is divided into eight Prahars, making each prahar equivalent to three hours. The first prahar starts at 3am.In Hindustani Music there are ragas which are prescribed to be performed at particular prahar to maximize their aesthetic effects. $ 1st Prahar (3 AM to 6 AM) $ 2nd Prahar (6 AM to 9 AM) $ 3rd Prahar (9 AM to 12 PM) $ 4th Prahar (12 PM to 3 PM)$ 5th Prahar (3 PM to 6 PM) $ 6th Prahar (6 PM to 9 PM) $ 7th Prahar (9 PM to 12 AM) $ 8th Prahar (12 AM to 3 AM);http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prahar
